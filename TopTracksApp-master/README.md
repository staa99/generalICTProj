TopTracksApp
============

This is a sample Android app I wrote to demonstrate how to fetch content from web services and integrate into a ListActivity with a custom layout.  The goal was to make this as simple as possible for my students to understand, while at the same time having an app that actually does something interesting.  This particular app integrates with the Last.FM web services.  You can read more about it as well as find a link to a YouTube video of my lecture on my blog posting entitled [Successfully Integrating Web Services Into Your Android Apps](http://www.themobilemontage.com/2012/11/29/successfully-integrating-web-services-into-your-android-apps/).

Note in order to compiler and run this sample code you need to create yourself a developer account on Last.FM's [developer website](http://www.last.fm/api) and create an application token. You will need to update the token in the constant string LastFMMetroTrackChartUrl defined in LastFMHelper.java with your token.
